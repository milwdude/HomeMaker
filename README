What is HomeMaker?

    In short, an express bus to Lazy Town.
    
    HomeMaker is a very basic script designed to automate all of the tedious 
    little steps involved in setting up a new Linux installation, ensuring 
    that all of the programs, configurations and settings I can't function 
    without are in place and ready to go without having to manually do all 
    of the typing needed to make that happen. I do a fair amount of distro 
    hopping and I'm incredibly particular about how I want my home directory 
    to function, so automating this process is a huge time-saver.

    Most of this script (and the packages and repos it installs) is devoted 
    to implementing changes that optimize a system for audio production, 
    as well as changes that make it easier to manage resources on a multi-boot 
    computer with multiple Linux installations, such as creating links within 
    the home directory to a separate, common data partition.

    This script utilizes various sub-scripts, files, and directories, the 
    structure of which has been designed to facilitate organization, identification, 
    and above all, customization and modulatiry. To that end, I have attempted 
    to document (perhaps excessively) everything and anything, so that you 
    (read: I) can figure out what's going on and how.

Why the Name?

    Because it’s descriptive - which means I’m more likely to remember what 
    it does three years from now when I’m working with even fewer brain 
    cells than I have now. Among other things, the script transforms the 
    barren home directory of a newly installed distribution into something 
    I find more useful, more like... home. 
    
    And, in addition to being marginally clever, the name is undoubtedly 
    easier than saying “That script that installs all that software, creates 
    a bunch of symlinks, and changes a couple of configurations.”

Considerations and Disclaimer

    Have I done any rigorous testing? Duh... Lazy Town here, remember?
    
    But in the spirit of kindness, here's some important info:

    This script *should* work on most arch-based systems (using official 
    arch repos and the aur) and most Ubuntu-based systems (16.04 minimum). 
    Other Distributions are not supported. 
    
    To speed up software installation the script may utilize a collection 
    of pre-compiled binary packages in “pkg.tar.xz” format for installation 
    by the “pacman” package manager, and/or pre-compiled binary packages 
    in “deb” format for installation by the “dpkg” package manager. In addition, 
    the script requires internet access so that it can download other packages 
    as needed. This script is designed to configure and install packages 
    compiled for 64-bit systems only, and some of the changes are intended 
    to alter configurations only relevant to the KDE or XFCE desktop environments.

    This script makes numerous changes to your system – including the installation 
    of binary packages and the use of unofficial repositories. It also sets 
    up symlinks that will work only if the source directories exist. As 
    such, if you intend to use this script, you should inspect all of it, 
    understand what it does, and alter it to suit your tastes or needs. 

    I am not responsible for any damage this script may do to your system, 
    your data, your hardware, your life or your mental state.
    
    That said, the only claim I can make is that using this script could 
    possibly fuck up your entire system. Or possibly kill your hampster. 
    Or it might make setting up your new home directory easier. It's a crap 
    shoot really. Enjoy!

* Gentle Translation (for those who unable to read between the lines)

    This script implements changes I alone fancy. They include configurations 
    that I find useful, and packages that I feel are indispensable. Syntax 
    and coding choices reflect what I find most useful with regard to simplicity, 
    clarity and ease of future alteration. This all works for ME, in a way 
    that makes sense to ME. I don’t expect anyone to agree with, endorse 
    or accept these choices. In fact, I think you’d be better served by 
    implementing a version of this script that reflects your own tastes 
    and preferences.

    I am sharing this in the spirit of openness. I am sharing this with 
    the desire to contribute in some small way to the greater good. Mostly, 
    however, I am sharing this because a friend said “Hey, that’s kinda 
    cool... how did you do that?”

    If you can use this script (or any part of it) in a way that you consider 
    useful, then I’m super happy I was able to add value to your existence!

    If you believe something could or should be done differently, go ahead 
    and do it however you think it should be done.

* Blunt Translation (for those who still aren't getting it)

    Feel free to use anything you find useful, but realize that your feedback 
    is neither required nor desired.

    If you believe this script can be improved, simplified or otherwise 
    amended so as to increase its functionality or execution, you are free 
    to apply said changes to your own implementation.

    If you believe that I have any interest in hearing about your ideas 
    or opinions, then by all means do kindly go fuck yourself. 

    Opinions (as they say) are like assholes – and I’ve got one already, 
    thanks!
