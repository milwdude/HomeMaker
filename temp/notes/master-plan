General Flow

1 - basic setup

	*run tests (see resources/tests)
    
	*set/export environmental variables (see resources/envar-list)

2 - install dependencies

	*install all requirements using appropriate package manager (see resources/dependencies)
        
3 - setup /etc/fstab

	A - create mountpoint '/media/joseph/shared-storage'
                
		*requires admin priviledges 
                    
		*uses $regUser to assign 'joseph', must be exported by the calling script (script #1)
                
	2. adds an entry to /etc/fstab using: cat info/etcfstab >> /etc/fstab
                
		*requires admin priviledges
                    
		*the file info/etcfstab must be present in the correct location

There are several directories within the root HomeMaker folder:

	/architect		-subproject designed to help users create ther own customized version of the script

	/assets		-generally binary application packages which may be difficult to easily install (customized compilations, not in default repos, etc)

	/attic		-

	/contractors	-

	/overseer		-

	/renovations	-

	/scrapbooks	-

	/skeletons	-

	/vault		-

HomeMaker

	1. include qarma (or other) binary so that functionality of dialogs is 
	guaranteed

	2. use variables to select both source (h.m. datastore) and destination (target 
	home dir) - this way the script should work in various environments (etc. 
	portable usb installs, home dirs on other partitions, etc)

	3. provide incremental confirmation dialogs for destructive options

	4. create a builder script which allows user to build a custom HM assistant. 

	(sub-project: HomeMaker Architect)

	5. create a master list of all source files with accompanying descriptions.

	6. lists of source files should be grouped together by application or task (i.e. 
	console related files, themes for gtk3, personal shell scripts, etc) and saved 
	as a ndividual "definition" files. each definition file should be given a 
	unique, descriptive name. at run time, these definitions can be copied into a 
	renovation directory, and any. definition found there will be included in the 
	remodel.

datastore directories;

HomeMaker/
the top levell- the entire HomeMaker project lives here


HomeMaker/skeletons

	various files that act as templates when setting up new Renovations at cetera. 
	Also, a complete copy of the Homemaker project and archived form so that users 
	can start anew without losing all of their existing data


General description of the entire renovation process with pointers to the 
included directories and Scripts, detailed descriptions
